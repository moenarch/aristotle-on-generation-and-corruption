<p>It has been established before' that the coming-to-be of the 'simple' bodies is reciprocal.
At the same time, it is manifest, even on the evidence of perception, that they do come-to-be: for otherwise there would not have been 'alteration, since 'alteration' is change in respect to the qualities of the objects of touch.
Consequently, we must explain (i) what is the manner of their reciprocal transformation, and (ii) whether every one of them can come to-be out of every one-or whether some can do so, but not others.</p>
<p>Now it is evident that all of them are by nature such as to change into one another: for coming-to-be is a change into contraries and out of contraries, and the 'elements' all involve a contrariety in their mutual relations because their distinctive qualities are contrary.
For in some of them both qualities are contrary-e.g.
in Fire and Water, the first of these being dry and hot, and the second moist and cold: while in others one of the qualities (though only one) is contrary-e.g.
in Air and Water, the first being moist and hot, and the second moist and cold.
It is evident, therefore, if we consider them in general, that every one is by nature such as to come-to-be out of every one: and when we come to consider them severally, it is not difficult to see the manner in which their transformation is effected.
For, though all will result from all, both the speed and the facility of their conversion will differ in degree.</p>
<p>Thus (i) the process of conversion will be quick between those which have interchangeable 'complementary factors', but slow between those which have none.
The reason is that it is easier for a single thing to change than for many.
Air, e.g.
will result from Fire if a single quality changes: for Fire, as we saw, is hot and dry while Air is hot and moist, so that there will be Air if the dry be overcome by the moist.
Again, Water will result from Air if the hot be overcome by the cold: for Air, as we saw, is hot and moist while Water is cold and moist, so that, if the hot changes, there will be Water.
So too, in the same manner, Earth will result from Water and Fire from Earth, since the two 'elements' in both these couples have interchangeable 'complementary factors'.
For Water is moist and cold while Earth is cold and dry-so that, if the moist be overcome, there will be Earth: and again, since Fire is dry and hot while Earth is cold and dry, Fire will result from Earth if the cold pass-away.</p>
<p>It is evident, therefore, that the coming-to-be of the 'simple' bodies will be cyclical; and that this cyclical method of transformation is the easiest, because the consecutive 'clements' contain interchangeable 'complementary factors'.
On the other hand (ii) the transformation of Fire into Water and of Air into Earth, and again of Water and Earth into Fire and Air respectively, though possible, is more difficult because it involves the change of more qualities.
For if Fire is to result from Water, both the cold and the moist must pass-away: and again, both the cold and the dry must pass-away if Air is to result from Earth.
So' too, if Water and Earth are to result from Fire and Air respectively-both qualities must change.</p>
<p>This second method of coming-to-be, then, takes a longer time.
But (iii) if one quality in each of two 'elements' pass-away, the transformation, though easier, is not reciprocal.
Still, from Fire plus Water there will result Earth and Air, and from Air plus Earth Fire and Water.
For there will be Air, when the cold of the Water and the dry of the Fire have passed-away (since the hot of the latter and the moist of the former are left): whereas, when the hot of the Fire and the moist of the Water have passed-away, there will be Earth, owing to the survival of the dry of the Fire and the cold of the Water.
So, too, in the same Way, Fire and Water will result from Air plus Earth.
For there will be Water, when the hot of the Air and the dry of the Earth have passed-away (since the moist of the former and the cold of the latter are left): whereas, when the moist of the Air and the cold of the Earth have passed-away, there will be Fire, owing to the survival of the hot of the Air and the dry of the Earth-qualities essentially constitutive of Fire.
Moreover, this mode of Fire's coming-to-be is confirmed by perception.
For flame is par excellence Fire: but flame is burning smoke, and smoke consists of Air and Earth.</p>
<p>No transformation, however, into any of the 'simple' bodies can result from the passingaway of one elementary quality in each of two 'elements' when they are taken in their consecutive order, because either identical or contrary qualities are left in the pair: but no 'simple' body can be formed either out of identical, or out of contrary, qualities.
Thus no 'simple' body would result, if the dry of Fire and the moist of Air were to pass-away: for the hot is left in both.
On the other hand, if the hot pass-away out both, the contraries-dry and moist-are left.
A similar result will occur in all the others too: for all the consecutive 'elements' contain one identical, and one contrary, quality.
Hence, too, it clearly follows that, when one of the consecutive 'elements' is transformed into one, the coming-to-be is effected by the passing-away of a single quality: whereas, when two of them are transformed into a third, more than one quality must have passedaway.</p>
<p>We have stated that all the 'elements' come-to-be out of any one of them; and we have explained the manner in which their mutual conversion takes place.
Let us nevertheless supplement our theory by the following speculations concerning them.</p>
